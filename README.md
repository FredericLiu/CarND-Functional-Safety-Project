- Lane keeping assistance: When the driver drift toward the edge of the lane, the steering wheel is turned toward the center of the lane to keep the car on its current lane.


This repo contains all the files to complete the car nanodegree functional safety project. Udacity also provids the same files in a google drive folder. Here is the link to the Google Drive folder: [Link to templates](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByaZfGJuntGTQWRpNUpuNVVGNlU)


The documentation consists on the following documents:
